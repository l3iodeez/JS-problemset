# JavaScript Practice

This practice problemset aims to evaluate your knowledge of JavaScript's basic
and intermediate features. You will not be tested on HTML Canvas,
jQuery, AJAX, or Underscore templates.

The specs live in the `spec/` directory. Your code
should go in the `src/` directory in the files provided. All your
functions should be namespaced under `Assessment` or be added to an existing
prototype.

How to run the specs: open up `SpecRunner.html` in a browser.
